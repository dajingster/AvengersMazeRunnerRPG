# Maze
The game, an Avengers: Endgame themed maze to battle Thanos, is built using Java and StdDraw library. It processes user input to customize worlds, players, weapons, enemies, and levels by generating all game elements following a pseudo-random algorithm using A* graph search. Players can save, load, replay, and view history. The game also includes easter eggs and cheat codes.
