Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: We have to make sure the rooms fit nicely with each other and don't overlap.

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: The ability to create one world.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: A hallway is a "connector" of sorts, whereas a room is a large conglomeration of tiles at the end of a hallway.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: Mine was too rigid and relied on the specific dynamics of the room's dimensions, which tells me the lesson that I shouldn't get too granular in my code.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: Understood, will do.
